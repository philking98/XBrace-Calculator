	<title>X-Brace Calculator - The Why</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div class="whole-page">
		<p>
			Why (and possibly what) is an X-Brace calculator.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a avid follower of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RRBuildings">
			RRBuilding on YouTube</a>. Most of Kyle and Greg's videos are about building 
			modern post and beam buildings ("pole barns").
		</p>
		<p>
			When constructing larger building, bracing in the form of "x"s are placed in 
			the frame. Adding the "X braces" requires the angle and length of the lumber 
			to be calculated. The video below shows how Kyle goes about calculating and 
			installing his "X" braces.

		</p>
		<p>			
			Here is a diagram of what the geometry looks like:
			<img alt="X-Brace geometry" src="./img/xbrace-diagram.svg">
		</p>
		<p>
			In the video, Kyle approximates the angle <span class="var-text">t</span> using a triangle with sides <span class="var-text">w</span> and <span class="var-text">h/n</span> 
			(the actual angle <span class="var-text">t</span> has sides <span class="var-text">w</span> and <span class="var-text">h<sub>1</sub></span>). The approximate angle <span class="var-text">t</span> allows Kyle to
			calculate the value of <span class="var-text">h<sub>2</sub></span>. The value <span class="var-text">h<sub>1</sub></span> is calculates from <span class="var-text">h/n</span> minus the approximated 
			<span class="var-text">h<sub>2</sub></span>. A final value for <span class="var-text">t</span> and the length of the brace, <span class="var-text">l</span> is then calculated.
		</p>
		<p>
			My curiosity got the best of me and I wanted to see if it was possible to derive the 
			dimensions for the x brace (<span class="var-text">t</span> and <span class="var-text">l</span>) without using the approximation. I believe I have 
			an answer which is <a href="themath.html">documented here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>		
			I implemented the calculation in <a href="index.html">javascript and html</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the example in the video I linked above, the height of the bay (<span class="var-text">h</span>) is 222", the width of 
			the bay (<span class="var-text">w</span>) is 7' 2 1/4", the lumber is 2x6 so the width of the brace (<span class="var-text">d</span>) is 5 1/2", and 
			2 braces (<span class="var-text">n</span>) are being constructed. Using Kyle's method, he calculates a brace length (<span class="var-text">l</span>) as 
			133 5/8" and angle (<span class="var-text">t</span>) of 49.80° or pitch of 14 3/16". Using my x brace calculator, I 
			get a brace length (<span class="var-text">l</span>) of 133 15/16" and an angle (<span class="var-text">t</span>) of 49.91° or pitch of 14 1/4".
		</p>

			As Kyle says "the math doesn't lie".
