# XBrace-Calculator

I am a avid follower of [@RRBuilding on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@RRBuildings). 
Most of Kyle and Greg's videos are about building modern post and beam buildings
("pole barns").

When constructing larger building, bracing in the form of "x"s are placed in the frame.
Adding the "X braces" requires the angle and length of the lumber to be calculated. The
video below shows how Kyle goes about calculating and installing his "X" braces.

Here is a diagram of what the geometry looks like:
